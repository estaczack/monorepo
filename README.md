# BSS Monorepo

## Rules to use the BSS Monorepo

- If you need to do something that is not under the umbrella of these rules, please ask **Ed de Almeida**.

- Only create a new component if you can't find one in the common area.

- Components in common area may impact all the systems. BE CAREFUL WITH THEM.

- Do NOT remove funcionalities from the common area components. You may add funcionalities, as far as they do NOT impact the already implemented ones.

- Always consider the possibility of using the DECORATOR paradigm, creating a new component based on a previous one and adding new things.

## To run the projects you need...

- Do ```npm install``` in the monorepo root folder

- Do ```npm install``` in the project you want to run
