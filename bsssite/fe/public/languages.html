                  <p>In the rapidly evolving context of technology, the pursuit of continuous updating and improvement
                    is
                    an undeniable necessity for IT professionals in Brazil. Alongside technical skills, mastery of the
                    English language has become an essential tool for success in the industry.</p>

                  <p>Statistical data reveals that the technology market in Brazil has experienced remarkable growth in
                    recent years. According to research, the sector grew by approximately 9.8% in 2021 and continues to
                    expand. With the adoption of digital transformation across various industries, the demand for
                    qualified
                    IT professionals is high, presenting a range of opportunities for those seeking to excel in this
                    field.</p>

                  <p>However, one of the main challenges faced by many IT professionals in Brazil is a lack of English
                    fluency. According to statistics, only around 5% of the Brazilian population possesses advanced
                    levels
                    of proficiency in the English language. This scenario represents a significant obstacle to the full
                    development of these professionals' careers.</p>

                  <p>The scarcity of English-proficient professionals directly impacts job vacancies and opportunities
                    that cannot be adequately filled. Many companies seek talents who can communicate fluently in
                    English,
                    whether it's to interact with international clients, collaborate on global projects, or stay updated
                    on international market trends. Therefore, language proficiency is an important differentiator for
                    securing strategic and valued positions in the Brazilian technology market.</p>

                  <p>When comparing the Brazilian scenario with other developing countries such as China, India,
                    Indonesia, and South Africa, it becomes apparent that these nations have distinguished themselves by
                    emphasizing English language learning. In these countries, English is widely regarded as a
                    fundamental
                    skill for both professional and personal growth, almost becoming a requirement for IT professionals
                    seeking opportunities in the global market.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, in Brazil, many professionals still struggle to keep up with international demand due to
                    the language barrier. This results in missed opportunities for collaboration with foreign companies,
                    participation in innovative projects, and access to cutting-edge technical and scientific knowledge.
                  </p>

                  <p>In light of this panorama, it is evident that learning and improving English is a crucial step for
                    IT
                    professionals in Brazil. Those who invest in language fluency will be better prepared to face the
                    challenges of the global technology industry, open doors to international opportunities, and
                    contribute significantly to the country's development. English is not just a language but a powerful
                    tool for professional growth and a lever for achieving success in the competitive technology market.

                  <p>Daniel Magno is an English instructor who lives in São José – Santa Catarina. Active in his brand
                    Magndon since 2017, he advocates for education as the main instrument to combat inequalities,
                    promote diversity, and foster a space for debating current controversial topics.</p>
                  <p>Daniel began his career in the technology field in 2008, working as a computer technician, IT
                    assistant, programmer, analyst, and systems consultant. However, due to homophobia, he chose to
                    leave this field and venture into another profession, using his passion for the English language,
                    which has always been with him since childhood, and led him to become a language instructor.</p>
                  <p>His experience with international IT projects and constant contact with foreign suppliers and
                    clients like Qlik, Lufthansa, and RackSpace greatly contributed to his ability to create customized
                    classes focused on conversation. Segments of his English lessons are shared on his social media as
                    "Torture Session," aptly named to break down the fear presented by students when facing native
                    English speakers. The Torture Session can be followed for free on LinkedIn and YouTube using the
                    hashtag #magndonst. These are short videos presenting very useful words and expressions with dual
                    subtitles in English and Portuguese.</p>
                  <p>Inspired by materials published on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube,
                    Daniel created his own teaching material. The videos provide support and complement another resource
                    used by Magndon: Ellii - a Canadian provider of didactic material.</p>
                  <p>Magndon takes pride in being a school run by a gay teacher who turned his room into a classroom via
                    Google Meet meetings. Despite being small, Magndon has already conducted conversation rounds and
                    dubbing sessions with natives from the United States, South Africa, United Kingdom, Australia,
                    and New Zealand.</p>
